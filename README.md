my summer training project for the 2nd year of my undergraduation
this is a simple music player app 
which will use the shared content data of your android phones and will play the mp3 file choosed by the user
it also has an option to record the audio and the audio will get stored in the database
it also has the webview tab being used to search for any song on goolge
it also displays the playlist created within your android phone
